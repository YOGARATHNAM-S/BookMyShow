# BookMyShow Application

This repository contains the source code for the **BookMyShow Application** project, which I built during the **7-Day Guvi Buildathon Workshop**. The project showcases the development of a complete web application using modern web development technologies.

## Overview
The BookMyShow Application is a full-stack web project that replicates a ticket booking platform. It demonstrates front-end design, dynamic interactivity, API integration, backend development, and database management.

## Features
- **Frontend**:
  - Responsive and dynamic user interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
  - Pages include home, movie listing, booking details, and confirmation screens.

- **Backend**:
  - Developed using **Node.js** to handle server-side logic.
  - **Postman API** was used for API testing.

- **Database**:
  - Integrated with **MongoDB** for data persistence (e.g., user details, movie information, booking history).

- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted for real-time access and interaction.
